              A Department of Agriculture was opened in the same year to provide
              a number of ad hoc courses of varying duration, from a few terms
              to three years, for the Ministry of Agriculture. A Department of
              General Studies was also instituted to prepare students for the
              Higher School Certificate Examinations in both Science and Arts
              subjects and to give instruction in such subjects as were
              requested by the other departments.

              Building
            </h3>
            <p>
              Once established, the College began to grow and in 1957, the
              School of Architecture, Town Planning and Building was inaugurated
              and its first students were admitted in January, 1958, for
              professional courses in Architecture, Town Planning and Building.
              As the College expanded, it was decided to make the Kumasi College
              of Technology a purely science and technology institution. In
              pursuit of this policy, the Teacher Training College, with the
              exception of the Art School, was transferred in January, 1958, to
              the Winneba Training College, and in 1959 the Commerce Department
              was transferred to Achimota to form the nucleus of the present
              School of administration of the University of Ghana, Legon.
